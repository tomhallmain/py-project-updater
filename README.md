# Python Project Updater

Problem - an extendible project repository exists, and the extensions contained inside not only have their own git indexes, but also have varying degrees of up-to-date status, and sometimes clash with the main project's dependencies. What is the fastest way to update the repository to the highest possible dependency version of each required package, and can a state diagram be presented to the user in a readable and helpful manner?
